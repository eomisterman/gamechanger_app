## Directions
- Please commit your changes at least 24 hours before your visit and confirm your submission with your point of contact or let them know if you have any questions.
- Make sure you get to a working state. We're going to build some new features on top of your existing solution when you come into the office.  Feel free to focus more on the front-end or the back-end as you see fit.
- We think it should normally take about a couple hours to comple this assignment, but you are free to dedicate as much time as you see fit.
- The prompt is language-agnostic; feel free to choose the language(s) and technologies you are most comfortable with.
- We'll be running your software on our machines, so please include any setup instructions needed to run your solution.
